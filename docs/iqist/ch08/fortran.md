## Fortran APIs

Since most of the components of the iQIST software package are developed with the Fortran 90 language, it is straightforward to provide a general application programming interface for external Fortran programs. With this interface, we have the full control of the CT-HYB and HF-QMC quantum impurity solvers, and atomic eigenvalue problem solver in the iQIST software package.

Next, we will unleash the secrets of the Fortran APIs for the iQIST software package.
