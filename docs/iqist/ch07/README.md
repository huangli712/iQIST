# Auxiliary tools

In the **HIBISCUS** component, many auxiliary tools are provided to deal with the input/output data of the CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers. Here we briefly describe some of these tools.

* [Maximum entropy method](mem.md) // **HIBISCUS**/entropy code.
* [Stochastic analytical continuation](sac.md) // **HIBISCUS**/stoch code.
* [Analytical continuation for self-energy](swing.md) // **HIBISCUS**/swing code.
* [Toolbox](toolbox.md) // **HIBISCUS**/toolbox codes.
* [Scripts](script.md) // **HIBISCUS**/scripts codes.

In principle, the **JASMINE** component (an atomic eigenvalue problem solver) is also an auxiliary tool for the CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers. Since it is very important, we introduce it in chapter [Atomic eigenvalue problem solver](../ch06/README.md) individually.
