# Applications

Together with the iQIST software package, we further provide a few important applications in order to demonstrate the powerfulness and usefulness of it. These applications are built on top of the iQIST code. They are coupled with the iQIST tightly. Especially, they strongly rely on the common service subroutine library (CSSL) and common service module library (CSML) in the iQIST. All of the applications are in production. You can use them in realistic research. We hope that these applications will be helpful for you. 

Now the iQIST software package only contain two applications. They are:

* [DFT + DMFT](dft_dmft.md) // To deal with the electronic structures of realistic strongly correlated materials.
* [Ladder dual fermions](ladder.md) // A diagrammatic extension of the single-site dynamical mean-field theory.

Enjoy them.
