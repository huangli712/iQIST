# Quantum Monte Carlo impurity solvers

It is time to look inside the quantum impurity solvers implemented in the iQIST software package. In this chapter, we will explain the essential information about how to setup the quantum impurity solvers components. This is the most important chapter in this manual. Even if you are already an expert of the iQIST software package, this chapter is still helpful.

The contents in this chapter are related with the following components:

* **AZALEA**
* **GARDENIA**
* **NARCISSUS**
* **BEGONIA**
* **LAVENDER**
* **CAMELLIA**
* **PANSY**
* **MANJUSHAKA**
* **DAISY**

The main topics are as follows:

* [How to choose suitable quantum impurity solvers?](choose.md) // So many CT-HYB impurity solvers!?
* [Standard input files](input.md) // Input stuffs.
* [Standard output files](output.md) // Output stuffs.
* [Parameters](parameters.md) // Really a reference manual.
