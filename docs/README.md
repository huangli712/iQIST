## About

This is the documentation for the iQIST software package. It is developed with the `Markdown` language and the `Documenter.jl` package.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the [`Julia programming language`](https://julialang.org/) was installed in your system and the [`Documenter.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) package was ready. The latest versions of them are always preferred.

## Compile the docs

Just type the following command in your terminal. Here `$` is only the prompt.

```shell
$ julia make.jl
```

Then `Documenter.jl` will automatically generate some static webs for the documentation.

## Read the docs

If everything is OK, you will find a new directory - `build` - under the `docs` folder. Get in it and then double click the `index.html` file to open it with web browser (perhaps it is `Chrome` or `Firefox`). Enjoy it!
