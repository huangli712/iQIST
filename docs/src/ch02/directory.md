# Directory Structures

The uncompressed iQIST software package is somewhat complicated, but have a rich content. We think that it is helpful to introduce the detailed directory structure of it. As has been explained before, in the following, we always use the term **iqist** to denote the top folder which contains the uncompressed iQIST software package.
