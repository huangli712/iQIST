## Directory structures

The uncompressed iQIST software package is somewhat complicated, but have a rich content. We think that it is helpful to introduce the detailed directory structure of it. As has been explained before, in the following, we always use the term **iqist** to denote the top folder which contains the uncompressed iQIST software package.

**Figure** | The directory structures of the iQIST software package.

### Where is the compling system?

```
iqist/build
```

### Where are the executable programs installed by default?

```
iqist/build
```

!!! warning 

    You have to compile the iQIST successfully, and then execute 
    ```
    $ iqist/build/x_setup.sh
    ```
    at first. So that the executable programs will be copied into the iqist/build directory.

### Where are the source codes?

```
iqist/src
```

### Where are the applications or plugins?

```
iqist/src/app
```

### Where is the base library?

```
iqist/src/base
```

!!! note

    The base library includes CSSL and CSML, which provide the numerical infrastructures for the other components of iQIST.

### Where are the application programming interfaces?

```
iqist/src/capi
```

### Where are the quantum impurity solvers?

* For CT-QMC quantum impurity solvers
