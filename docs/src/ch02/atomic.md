### Build atomic eigenvalue problem solver

The **JASMINE** component is the built-in atomic eigenvalues solver. If you want to use the **BEGONIA**, **LAVENDER**, **PANSY**, **MANJUSHAKA**, **CAMELLIA** components, the **JASMINE** component is the necessary pre-processing tool. You can employ the following commands to compile it.

**Method 1**:
```
$ cd iqist/build
$ editor make.sys
$ make base
$ make capi
$ make jasmine
$ ./x_setup.sh
```

!!! note

    1. Here **editor** means any ascii text editor you prefer.
    2. If the base library and the application programming interfaces were already compiled successfully, then you can skip the following commands:
    ```sh
    $ make base
    $ make capi
    ```

This is the most common and direct method. After a few minutes, you will find a *jasmine.x* file in the *iqist/build* directory. That is what you need, the executable program for the **JASMINE** component. After that you can add it to the system path, and do some tests.

**Method 2**:

In this approach, we go to the directory of the **JASMINE** component at first. Then 'make' it as usual.

```
$ cd iqist/src/tools/jasmine
$ make
```

Here, we assume that the compiling system was correctly configured, the base library and the application programming interfaces were already compiled successfully.

!!! note

    Now the executable program will not be copied into the *iqist/build* directory. You have to go to the *iqist/build* directory, and execute
    ```sh
    $ ./x_setup.sh
    ```
