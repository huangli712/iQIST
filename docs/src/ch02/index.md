# Installation

Are you interested in the iQIST software package? 

Yes?
Do you have passion for iQIST and want to have a try?

Yes? Great!

In this chapter, we will guide you to compile and install the iQIST software package step by step. Supposing that you have installed the iQIST software package successfully, you can skip this chapter and go to the next one.

Basic recipes:
* [Obtain](obtain.md) // How to get the source codes?
* [Uncompress](uncompress.md) // Hmm, un-tar it.
* [Directory structures](directory.md) // Where are the quantum impurity solvers?
* [Compiling environment](envir.md) // Fortran compiler and math library.
* [Compiling system](system.md) // How to make it?
* [Build iQIST at one step](full.md) // Quickly build.

Advanced recipes:
* [Build quantum impurity solvers](solvers.md) // Core components.
* [Build atomic eigenvalues solver](atomic.md) // Companion of the quantum impurity solvers.
* [Build documentation](docs.md) // User manual.

!!! note

    1. We assume that you are familiar with the basic terminal commands/operations of Linux system.

    2. We assume that the **root directory** of the iQIST software package is just **iqist** in the manual, except stated explicitly. For example, if the iQIST software package was installed at `/home/lihuang/iqist2016`, then we just use **iqist** to denote this directory.
