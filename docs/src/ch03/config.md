# Configure your system

Please add the directory which includes the executable programs of iQIST software package to your system path. Usually, you can modify the *.bashrc* file in your home directory to reach this goal:

```shell
export PATH=iqist/build:$PATH
```

If you don't know how to modify the system environment variables, please consult your system administrator at first.
