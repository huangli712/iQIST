# Getting started

Well, I guesss that you have compiled and installed the iQIST software package on your system successfully. And you cannot help trying it now. But wait, there is still a lot of stuffs you have to keep in mind before you submit the iQIST-related jobs in your queue system.

* [Configure your system](config.md) // Environment variables.
* [iQIST recipes](recipes.md) // The basic workflow for cooking with iQIST.
* [Prepare input files](create.md) // Are you ready?
* [Execute the codes](execute.md) // MPI vs. OpenMP, paralleled or serial.
* [Monitor the codes](monitor.md) // What's the status of the code?
* [Profile the codes](profile.md) // Is it possible to accelerate the code further?

OK, if you are already familiar with the basic usage of the iQIST software package, then you can read the following advanced topics.

* [Quantum Monte Carlo impurity solvers](../ch04/README.md) // A comprehensive reference about the impurity solvers.
* [Applications](../ch05/README.md) // The applications, plugins that are built on top of it.
* [Atomic eigenvalue problem solver](../ch06/README.md) // A comprehensive reference about the atomic eigenvalue solver.
* [Auxiliary tools](../ch07/README.md) // Full descriptions about the auxiliary toolbox.
* [Application programming interfaces](../ch08/README.md) // How to use iQIST via external Python/Fortran programs.
* [Inside iQIST](../ch10/README.md) // The principles, tricks, formulations, algorithms that implemented in iQIST.
