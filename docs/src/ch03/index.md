# Outline

Well, I guesss that you have compiled and installed the iQIST software package on your system successfully. And you cannot wait trying it now. But wait, there is still a lot of stuffs you have to keep in mind before you submit the iQIST-related jobs in your queue system.

* [Configure Your System](config.md) // About environment variables.
* [iQIST Recipes](recipes.md) // The basic workflow for cooking with iQIST.
* [Prepare Input Files](create.md) // Are you ready?
* [Execute The Codes](execute.md) // MPI vs. OpenMP, paralleled or serial.
* [Monitor The Codes](monitor.md) // What's the status of the code?
* [Profile The Codes](profile.md) // Is it possible to accelerate the code further?

OK, if you are already familiar with the basic usage of the iQIST software package, then you can read the following advanced topics.

* [Quantum Impurity Solvers](../ch04/index.md) // A comprehensive reference about the quantum impurity solvers.
* [Atomic Eigenvalue Problem Solver](../ch05/index.md) // A comprehensive reference about the atomic eigenvalue problem solver.
* [Auxiliary Tools](../ch06/index.md) // Full descriptions about the auxiliary toolbox.
* [Inside iQIST](../ch08/index.md) // The principles, tricks, formulations, algorithms that implemented in iQIST.
