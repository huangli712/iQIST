# Atomic Eigenvalue Problem Solver

The atomic eigenvalue problem solver is an important preprocessing tool for the general matrix version CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers. The purpose of it is to diagonalize the atomic Hamiltonian to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are essential input for some CT-HYB impurity solvers. In this chapter, we will introduce the **JASMINE** component, which is the only atomic eigenvalue problem solver in the iQIST software package. It should be used together with the **MANJUSHAKA** component.

The main topics are as follows:

* [Standard Input Files](input.md) // Input stuffs.
* [Standard Output Files] // Output stuffs.
* [Parameters](parameters.md) // Really a reference manual.
