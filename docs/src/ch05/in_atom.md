# solver.atomic.in

**Introduction**

The main configuration file for the atomic eigenvalue problem solver in the iQIST software package is the *solver.atomic.in* file.

Just like the CT-QMC quantum impurity solvers, since all of the input parameters have default values, the atomic eigenvalue problem solver can run without any input files. But if you want to use it to solve a specific problem, a well-prepared *solver.atomic.in* file is of course necessary.

**Format**

The *solver.atomic.in* file share the same format with the *solver.ctqmc.in* files. In other words, it adopts the simple "key-value" style. See [solver.ctqmc.in](../ch04/in_ctqmc.md) for more details.
