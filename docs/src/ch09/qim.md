### Quantum impurity model

The main goal of the iQIST software package is to provide a comprehensive tool for solving the quantum impurity models, especially the Anderson impurity model. Generally speaking, the multi-orbital Anderson impurity model (AIM) can be written as 

```math
H_{\text{imp}} = H_{\text{loc}} + H_{\text{bath}} + H_{\text{hyb}},
```

where

```math
\begin{align}
& H_{\text{loc}} = \sum_{\alpha\beta} E_{\alpha\beta} d_{\alpha}^{\dagger} d_{\beta}+\sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} U_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} 
    d^{\dagger}_{\alpha}d^{\dagger}_{\beta} d_{\gamma} d_{\delta}, \\
& H_{\text{hyb} } = \sum_{\textbf{k}\alpha\beta} V^{\alpha\beta}_{\textbf{k}} c_{\textbf{k}\alpha}^{\dagger} d_{\beta} + h.c., \\
& H_{\text{bath}} = \sum_{\textbf{k}\alpha} \epsilon_{\textbf{k}\alpha} c_{\textbf{k}\alpha}^{\dagger} c_{\textbf{k}\alpha}.
\end{align}
```

In these equations, Greek letters in the subscripts denote a combined spin-orbital index, the fermion operator ``d_\alpha^{\dagger}`` (``d_\alpha``) is creating (annihilating) an electron with index ``\alpha`` on the impurity site, while ``c_{\textbf{k}\alpha}^{\dagger}`` (``c_{\textbf{k}\alpha}``) is the creation (annihilation) operator for conduction band (bath) electron with spin-orbital index ``\alpha`` and momentum ``\textbf{k}``. 

The first term in ``H_{\text{loc}}`` is the general form of the impurity single particle term with energy level splitting and inter-orbital hybridization. This term can be generated by crystal field (CF) splitting or spin-orbit coupling (SOC), etc. The second term in ``H_{\text{loc}}`` is the Coulomb interaction term which can be parameterized by intra(inter)-band Coulomb interactions ``U`` ``(U')`` and Hund's rule coupling ``J`` or Slater integral parameters ``F^{k}``. The hybridization term ``H_{\text{hyb}}`` describes the process of electrons hopping from the impurity site to the environment and back. ``H_{\text{bath}}`` describes the non-interacting bath. This Anderson impurity model is usually solved self-consistently in the DMFT calculations.
