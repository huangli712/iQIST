Hi, welcome to the world of continuous-time quantum impurity solvers. 

This is the official user manual for the iQIST software package which implements several state-of-the-art continuous-time quantum impurity solvers. In this chapter, you will learn something you have to know about the continuous-time quantum impurity solvers, and of course the iQIST software package.

Are you ready? Let's go!

* [What's iQIST?](what.md) // Is it a food or an animal?
* [Motivation](motivation.md) // Why do we need the iQIST software package?
* [Components](components.md) // What does the iQIST software package include?
* [Features](feature.md) // What can we do by using the iQIST software package?
* [Software architecture](architecture.md) // A bird's eye view of the iQIST software package.
* [Policy](policy.md) // Some basic rules and tips.

If you are already familiar with the iQIST software package, perhaps you will be interested in the following advanced topics:

* [Quantum impurity solvers] // A comprehensive reference about the impurity solvers.
* [Atomic eigenvalue problem solver] // A comprehensive reference about the atomic eigenvalue solver.
* [Auxiliary tools] // Full descriptions about the auxiliary toolbox.
* [iQIST in action] // The applications, plugins that are built on top of iQIST.

If you want to learn the secrets of the iQIST software package, then diving into

* [Inside iQIST] // The principles, tricks, formulations, algorithms that are implemented in iQIST.

may be the best choices.
