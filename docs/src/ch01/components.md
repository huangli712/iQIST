# Components

The iQIST software package is much more complex and powerful than what you can imagine. It contains several components which can be used to solve various impurity problems, prepare the input files, post-process the calculated results, etc. According to their abilities and functions, the components of the iQIST software package can be classified into the following catalogues:

---

**Continuous-Time Quantum Impurity Solvers**
> * **NARCISSUS** Component
> * **MANJUSHAKA** Component

For the details of these quantum impurity solvers, please see the chapter [Quantum Impurity Solvers](../ch04/index.md).

---

**Atomic Eigenvalue Problem Solver**
> * **JASMINE** Component

For the details of these tools, please see the chapters [Atomic Eigenvalue Problem Solver](../ch05/index.md).

**Miscellanies**
> * **The Reference Manual** (It is me!)
> * [**Tutorials**](../ch07/index.md)
> * **Many Testings**
> * [**Useful Tools**](../ch06/index.md)

Besides the above solvers, the iQIST software package also includes many useful and interesting things.
