## What's iQIST?

The **I**nteracting **Q**uantum **I**mpurity **S**olver **T**oolkit (dubbed iQIST) is an open source software package aiming to provide a full, reliable, flexible, and powerful tool chain for various quantum impurity models. The major objective of iQIST is to be the core (computational) engine of the dynamical mean-field theory and its extensions.

The iQIST software package offers a few continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solvers (hybridization expansion version), a Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and numerous prep-processed and post-processed tools. Selected applications and plugins on top of it are also provided. It is an all-in-one software package. With it you can solve quantum impurity models and analyze the calculated results easily and efficiently. Of course, you can extend it or build complicated programs with it to fit your special requirements.
