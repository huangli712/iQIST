# Inside iQIST

There are three aspects for this chapter. 

First of all, we will present the basic principles of CT-QMC quantum impurity solvers, with an emphasis on the hybridization expansion technique. For detailed derivations and explanations, please refer to the great review article[^1]. Second, the algorithms, tricks, and optimization implemented in the iQIST software package are all discussed in details. Finally, we will introduce some technical and programming details for the iQIST from the programmer's perspective. We believe that those guys who would like to hack the iQIST software package to realize their own ideas will benefit from this.

The main topics are as follows:

* [Basic theory and methods](basic.md) // Principles for the CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers.
* [Algorithms](algo.md) // Why is it so fast and so powerful?
* [Codes](code.md) // Want to be a developer of the iQIST software package?
