# Typical examples

This chapter includes examples from basic application to real material calculation, which are recommended for the users to master the usage of iQIST.

We start from the half filled single Hubbard band model based on bethe lattice. And then we will illustrate the Mott transition through increasing Coulomb interaction strength. After that we would like to introduce the advanced physics by considering the general interaction and dynamical screening effect, etc. Finally, real material calculation will be addressed. Especially, the input and output files mentioned in previous chapters will be given in these examples. Postprocessing tools are in detailed description and figures are plotted to show the physics. 

Hope you enjoy these typical examples listed below to begin a new journey of learning and using iQIST.
