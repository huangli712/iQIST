### atom.sector.dat

**Introduction**

The *atom.sector.dat* file contains the configuration information for the subspaces of the local Hamiltonian. Only when *ictqmc* = 2, 3, 4, and 5, this file is generated. See [ictqmc](p_ictqmc.md) parameter for more details.

**Format**

The file format of the *atom.sector.dat* file is a bit complex. It is unnecessary to understand its full details. If you are a maintainer or developer of the **JASMINE** component, please read the source codes in *iqist/src/tools/jasmine/atomic_dump.f90*.
