### atom.cix

**Introduction**

The *atom.cix* file is the most important files generated by the **JASMINE** component. It is an all-in-one file which contains all of the necessary information for a given atomic eigenvalues problem. It is also one of the necessary input files for the CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers (general matrix version). Once it was created, you have to copy it to a correct directory, so that the quantum impurity solvers can find it out.

**Format**

The *atom.cix* has three different file formats. They are suitable for different quantum impurity solvers. Which file format is used depends on the *ictqmc* parameter. 

* **File Format A**, should be compatible with the **CAMELLIA** component
!!! note

    *ictqmc* = 0.

* **File Format B**, should be compatible with the **BEGONIA** and **LAVENDER** components
!!! note

    *ictqmc* = 1.

* **File Format C**, should be compatible with the **MANJUSHAKA** and **PANSY** components
!!! note

    *ictqmc* = 2, 3, 4, 5.

See [ictqmc](p_ictqmc.md) parameter for more details.

The file formats of the *atom.cix* file are a bit complex. It is unnecessary to understand its full details. If you are a maintainer or developer of the **JASMINE** component, please read the source codes in *iqist/src/tools/jasmine/atomic_dump.f90*.

See also [atom.cix](../ch04/in_atom.md) for more details.
