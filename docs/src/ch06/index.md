# Outline

In the iQIST software package, many auxiliary tools are provided to deal with the input/output data of the CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers. Here we briefly describe some of these tools.

* [Toolbox] // The toolbox codes.
* [Scripts] // The scripts codes.

In principle, the **JASMINE** component (an atomic eigenvalue problem solver) is also an auxiliary tool for the CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers. Since it is very important, we introduce it in chapter [Atomic Eigenvalue Problem Solver](../ch05/index.md) individually.
