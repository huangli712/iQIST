# Summary 

In this section, we will illustrate how to measure some representative physical observable. We will stress the implemented tricks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Monte Carlo measurement.

* [One-shot and self-consistent calculations]
* [Data binning mode]
* [Imaginary-time Green's function]
* [Matsubara Green's function and self-energy function]
* [Spin-spin correlation function and orbital-orbital correlation function]
* [Two-particle Green's function and vertex function]
