# Outline

You may have learnt a lot about iQIST from the previous chapters. In this chapter, we will show you how to do calculations using iQIST through many case studies. Before this, we presume that you have successfully installed iQIST package in your systems, and the install directory is */opt/iqist*, and the directory */opt/iqist/build* has been added to the PATH environment variable:

```
$ export PATH=/opt/iqist/build:$PATH
```

If you are new to iQIST, please follow the tutorials to learn it step by step. We believe that you will have become a master of iQIST after finishing all the tutorials. If you have been familiar with iQIST, there is no need to start from the beginning, you can choose some cases with your interests to learn directly.

Now the available tutorials will cover the following topics:

* [Basic Applications]
* [Advanced Applications I: Complex Systems]
* [Advanced Applications II: Accurate Measurements]
* [Advanced Applications III: Post-Processing Procedures]
* [Practical Exercises]

Beyond thatï¼Œwe also introduce some concrete examples to illustrate the correctness of the iQIST software package.

* [Code Validation]

Some successful stories and representative applications published in the scientific journals are also collected and listed here as a reference.
