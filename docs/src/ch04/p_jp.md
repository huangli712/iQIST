### Parameter: Jp

**Definition**

Strength of the pair-hopping term in the interaction term, ``J_p``.

**Type**

Float, double precision

**Default value**

0.0

**Component**

ALL, except for **DAISY** component.

**Behavior**

In principle, it is used to build the Coulomb interaction matrix. 

But the **AZALEA**, **GARDENIA**, **NARCISSUS** components don't support general interaction, in other words, they don't support the ``J_p`` term in the local impurity Hamiltonian. 

As for the **CAMELLIA**, **BEGONIA**, **LAVENDER**, **MANJUSHAKA**, and **PANSY** components, the Coulomb interaction matrix is not built within the quantum impurity solvers. All of the information is encapsulated in the *atom.cix* file. So they don't need the ``J_p`` parameter as well. 

So, in summary, we don't use this parameter actually. You can set it to any values as you wish. But we strongly suggest to set it to the exact value.
