### Parameter: chgrd

**Definition**

Number of linear grid points in [-1,1] which is used to define the Chebyshev polynomials.

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

20001

**Component**

Only for the **GARDENIA**, **NARCISSUS**, **LAVENDER**, **CAMELLIA**, and **MANJUSHAKA** components.

**Behavior**

The second kind Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials are defined in a linear grid in [-1,1]. And the number of grid points is controlled by this parameter.

**Comment**

This parameter is useful only when *isort* = 3 or *isort* = 6 . See [isort](p_isort.md) for more details. The 20001 is an optimal value for chgrd. It is not recommended to modify it. 

See also [chmax](p_chmax.md) for more details.

As for the applications of orthogonal polynomials in CT-QMC impurity solver, please refer to Lewin's[^1] and Hartmann's[^2] papers.
