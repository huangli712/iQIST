### Parameter: U

**Definition**

Averaged Coulomb interaction ``U``.

**Type**

Float, double precision

**Default value**

4.0

**Component**

ALL, except for **DAISY** component.

**Behavior**

Actually, it is not used by the quantum impurity solvers to build the Coulomb interaction matrix. It will be output by the impurity solver as a reference. You can set it to any values. I forgot why I had designed this parameter.

In the **BEGONIA**, **LAVENDER**, and **CAMELLIA** components, it is used as an internal variable. Any user-defined value will be overridden.

**Comment**

See also [Uc](p_uc.md), [Uv](p_uv.md), [Jz](p_jz.md), [Js](p_js.md) and [Jp](p_jp.md) parameters for more details.
