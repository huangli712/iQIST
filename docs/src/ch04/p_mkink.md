### Parameter: mkink

**Definition**

Maximum allowable diagrammatic perturbation order in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

1024

**Component**

ALL, except for the **DAISY** component.

**Behavior**

Determine the size of involved arrays. If the perturbation expansion order exceeds *mkink*, fatal error/exceptions will happen.

**Comment**

*mkink = 1024* is a safe setting on the condition that the temperature (controlled by the *beta* parameter) is not too low, the interaction (controlled by the *Uc*, *Uv*, *Jz*, etc,  parameters) is not too weak, the number of orbitals (controlled by the *nband* parameter) is not too large.
