### Parameter: issun

**Definition**

Key control flag, it is used to determine the symmetry of bands/orbitals.

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

2

**Component**

ALL

**Behavior**

There are two possible values for the *issun* parameter so far:

* *issun* = 1, the bands are not symmetrized.

* *issun* = 2, the bands are symmetrized according to symmetry matrix ```symm```.

The quantum impurity solvers will symmetrize the relevant physical quantities according to the *issun* parameter.

**Comment**

There is still one question. What's the symmetry matrix and where is it? 

In fact, we should call it symmetry vector, instead of symmetry matrix. It is an integer vector whose size is exact *norbs*. The quantum impurity solvers will use it to perform symmetrization. Let's suppose this vector is called ```symm```. For example, there is a 5-band model, the symmetry vector is as follows:

```fortran
symm(01) = 1
symm(02) = 2
symm(03) = 3
symm(04) = 4
symm(05) = 4
symm(06) = 4
symm(07) = 5
symm(08) = 5
symm(09) = 5
symm(10) = 1
```

Guess which orbitals are degenerated?

ehh, the orbitals 1 and 10, since ```symm(01)``` and ```symm(10)``` are all 1. Similarly, the orbitals 4, 5, and 6 are degenerated. The orbitals 7, 8, and 9 are degenerated as well.

Yes, you are right. The quantum impurity solvers will consider that those orbitals which have the same symmetry number (the element of ```symm```) are degenerated. 

By default, the elements in ```symm``` vector are 1. In other words, if *issun* = 2, all of the orbitals are degenerated. If you want to re-assign the degenerated orbitals, you can edit the *solver.eimp.in* file. See [solver.eimp.in](in_eimp.md) for more details.
