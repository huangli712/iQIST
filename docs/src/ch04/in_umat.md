### solver.umat.in

**Introduction**

The quantum impurity solvers will generate the Coulomb interaction matrix using the ``U`` and ``J`` parameters provided by you automatically. But sometimes you may want to customize the Coulomb interaction matrix by yourself. 

Is it possible within the iQIST code? 

Yes, of course.

You can define your Coulomb interaction matrix in the *solver.umat.in* file. And the iQIST codes will read data from it if it is available. Then the default Coulomb interaction matrix will be replaced with the new one. That's all.

!!! warning 

    The HF-QMC impurity solver (the **DAISY** component) does not support the *solver.umat.in* file. The continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solvers in the general matrix representation, i.e., the **BEGONIA**, **LAVENDER**, **CAMELLIA**, **MANJUSHAKA**, and **PANSY** components don't support this file/feature as well.

**Format**

The format of the *solver.umat.in* file is as follows:

---

*column 1*: orbital index ``i``, integer

*column 2*: orbital index ``j``, integer

*column 3*: Coulomb interaction matrix element ``U(i,j)``, double precision

---

!!! tip

    In the *solver.umat.in* file, we employed the following orbital sequence:
    $$1\uparrow$$, $$2\uparrow$$, $$3\uparrow$$, $$\cdots$$, $$1\downarrow$$, $$2\downarrow$$, $$3\downarrow$$, $$\cdots$$
    Namely, we put the spin up part before the spin down part.

**Code**

The corresponding Fortran code block for the reading of *solver.umat.in* file is as follows:

```fortran
open(mytmp, file='solver.umat.in', form='formatted', status='unknown')
do i=1,norbs
    do j=1,norbs
        read(mytmp,*) k, l, rtmp
        uumat(k,l) = rtmp
    enddo ! over j={1,norbs} loop
enddo ! over i={1,norbs} loop
close(mytmp)
```

Usually, you have to edit the *solver.umat.in* file by yourself.
