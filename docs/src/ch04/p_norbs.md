### Parameter: norbs

**Definition**

Number of correlated orbitals considered in the calculations.

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

2

**Component**

ALL

**Behavior**

Determine the size of involved arrays.

**Comment**

The following relations always hold.

```math 
\text{norbs} = \text{npsin} * \text{nband}
```

```math
\text{ncfgs} = 2^{\text{norbs}}
```

You have to ensure the value of *norbs* is compatible with *nband*, *nspin* and *ncfgs*. The quantum impurity solvers will not check and correct them automatically. So you have to setup them in the *solver.ctqmc.in* and *solver.hfqmc.in* files explicitly.

See also [nspin](p_nspin.md), [nband](p_nband.md), and [ncfgs](p_ncfgs.md) parameters.
