# Terminal output

**Introduction**

At run time, the quantum impurity solvers will generate a lot of output in the terminal. We usually redirect the terminal output to an external disk file in order to facilitate further analysis. The terminal output contains a lot of useful information, where we can learn the status of the solvers and extract some important physical quantities.

**Format**

The format/structure of the terminal output is a bit complex. Next, let's take a typical terminal output as an example to illustrate how to get some useful information from it.

!!! note

    The terminal outputs generated by various impurity solvers are somewhat different. But the main ingredients are similar.

The typical terminal output is as follows:

    part  :   1.00000    temp  : 232.09010
```

It is the header of the terminal output. In this part, we can get the following messages:

* The component we just used. Here it is the **GARDENIA** component.
* What is the version number is? And when was the compiling time of the code?
* What's the running mode? Is it parallel or sequential?
* When did the calculation start?
* How many cores were used in the calculation?
* All of the computational parameters. Are they reasonable?

**>>> Part 2**:

```
  GARDENIA >>> DMFT iter:999 <<< BINNING
  GARDENIA >>> CTQMC quantum impurity solver running
    nband :         2    Uc    :   4.40000
    nspin :         2    Jz    :   1.10000

    time:     0.000s

    quantum impurity solver warmming
    time:     1.083s

    quantum impurity solver sampling
```

In this part, we can get the following information:

* Is the data binning activated?
* What's the random number seed?

!!! note

    The random number seed is very important. With it we can recover the scene once a fatal error/exception occurs.

**>>> Part 3**:

    >>> quantum impurity solver status: normal
    >>> used time:  4 m 48.46 s in current iteration.
    >>> used time:  4 m 48.46 s in total iteration.
```

This is the most important part of the terminal output. The quantum impurity solvers will output this part every *nwrite* Monte Carlo sampling steps. So there are *nsweep/nwrite* similar parts in total. We usually extract useful data from the last part.

In this part, we can gain the following information:

* The progress of the impurity solver.
* Total energy, etot
* Potential energy, epot
* Kinetic energy, ekin
* Magnetic momentum, `` \langle S_z \rangle ``
* Total occupancy, ``\langle N^1 \rangle``, ``\langle N^2\rangle``
* Average of histogram, ``\langle K^2 \rangle``, ``\langle K^3 \rangle``, ``\langle K^4 \rangle``
* Probability for the accept/reject events for various update 
* Is the status of the solver normal?
* How long did the solver spend in this period?

!!! note

    From ``\langle N^1 \rangle`` and ``\langle N^2\rangle``, we can calculate the charge fluctuation. From ``\langle K^2 \rangle``, ``\langle K^3 \rangle``, and ``\langle K^4 \rangle``, we can calculate the skewness and kurtosis of the histogram of the perturbation expansion order.

**>>> Part 4**:

```
  GARDENIA >>> CTQMC quantum impurity solver shutdown

  GARDENIA >>> total time spent:   2987.44s

  GARDENIA >>> I am tired and want to go to bed. Bye!
  GARDENIA >>> happy ending at 15:24: 8 Dec 17 2015
```

This is the final part of the terminal output, from which you will find:

* How long did the solver spend in the whole calculation?
* When did the code terminate?

**Code**
