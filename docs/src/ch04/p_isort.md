### Parameter: isort

**Definition**

Key control flag. It is used to determine whether we should use the orthogonal polynomials trick to improve the accuracy and suppress the numerical noises. 

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

1

**Component**

Only for the **GARDENIA**, **NARCISSUS**, **LAVENDER**, **CAMELLIA**, and **MANJUSHAKA** components.

**Behavior**

There are six possible values for *isort* parameter so far:

* *isort* = 1, the standard method is used to measure ``G(\tau)``.

* *isort* = 2, the Legendre orthogonal polynomials trick is used to measure ``G(\tau)``.

* *isort* = 3, the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials trick is used to measure ``G(\tau)``.

* *isort* = 4, the standard method is used to measure ``G(\tau)`` and ``F(\tau)``.

* *isort* = 5, the Legendre orthogonal polynomials trick is used to measure ``G(\tau)`` and ``F(\tau)``.

* *isort* = 6, the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials trick is used to measure ``G(\tau)`` and ``F(\tau)``.

Here ``G(\tau)`` is the imaginary-time Green's function and ``F(\tau)`` auxiliary imaginary-time function which can be used to calculate ``\Sigma(i\omega_n)`` analytically. 

```math
\Sigma(i\omega_n) = \frac{F(i\omega_n)}{G(i\omega_n)}
```

If the orthogonal polynomials trick is used, the ``G(\tau)`` and ``F(\tau)`` are expanded using orthogonal polynomials. And then the expansion coefficients are measured during Monte Carlo sampling procedure. Finally, according the expansion coefficients the ``G(\tau)`` and ``F(\tau)`` can be calculated analytically.

The expansion series are defined by the *chmax*, *chgrd*, *lemax*, and *legrd* parameters.

The **GARDENIA** and **NARCISSUS** components support all of the six possible values of *isort*. However, in the **LAVENDER**, **CAMELLIA**, and **MANJUSHAKA** components, *isort* must be less than or equal to 3. In order words, the improved estimator for self-energy function was not implemented in the **LAVENDER**, **CAMELLIA**, and **MANJUSHAKA** components.

See [chmax](p_chmax.md), [chgrd](p_chgrd.md), [lemax](p_lemax.md), and [legrd](p_legrd.md) parameters for more details.
