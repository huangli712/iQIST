### Parameter: legrd

**Definition**

Number of linear grid points in [-1,1] which is used to define the Legendre polynomials.

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

20001

**Component**

Only for the **GARDENIA**, **NARCISSUS**, **CAMELLIA**, **LAVENDER**, and **MANJUSHAKA** components.

**Behavior**

The Legendre orthogonal polynomials are defined in a linear grid in [-1,1]. And the number of grid points are controlled by this parameter.

**Comment**

Only when *isort* = 2 or *isort* = 5 this parameter is useful. See [isort](p_isort.md) for more details. The 20001 is an optimal value for *legrd*. It is not suggested to modify it. 

See also [lemax](p_lemax.md) for more details.

As for the applications of orthogonal polynomials in CT-QMC impurity solver, please refer to Lewin's[^1] and Hartmann's[^2] papers.
