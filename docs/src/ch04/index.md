# Outline

It is time to look inside the quantum impurity solvers implemented in the iQIST software package. In this chapter, we will explain the essential information about how to setup the quantum impurity solvers components. This is the most important chapter in this manual. Even if you are already an expert of the iQIST software package, this chapter is still helpful.

The contents in this chapter are related with the following components:

* **NARCISSUS**
* **MANJUSHAKA**

The main topics are as follows:

* [How to choose suitable quantum impurity solvers?](choose.md) // So many CT-HYB quantum impurity solvers!?
* [Standard Input Files](input.md) // Input stuffs.
* [Standard Output Files](output.md) // Output stuffs.
* [Parameters](parameters.md) // Really a reference manual.

Maybe you are interested in the following related topics:

* [Getting started](../ch03/index.md) // To teach you how to setup and use the iQIST software package.
* [Atomic eigenvalue problem solver](../ch05/index.md) // Another reference manual.
* [Auxiliary tools](../ch06/index.md) // The companion of quantum impurity solvers.
* [iQIST in action] // Some lightweight tutorials.
* [Inside iQIST] // Unleashing the secrets inside the iQIST.
