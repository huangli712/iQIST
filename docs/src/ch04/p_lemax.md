### Parameter: lemax

**Definition**

The maximum allowable expansion order ``n`` for the Legendre orthogonal polynomials. It must be greater than 2.

The recursive definition for the Legendre polynomials is as follows:

```math
P_{0}(x) =1
```

```math
P_{1}(x) = x
```

```math
(n+1) P_{n+1}(x) = (2n+1)xP_{n}(x) - n P_{n-1}(x)
```

An important property of the Legendre polynomials is that they are orthogonal with respect to the ``L^2`` inner product on the interval ``âˆ’1 \leq x\leq 1``:

```math
\int^{1}_{-1} P_{m}(x) P_{n}(x) dx = \frac{2}{2n+1}\delta_{mn}
```

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

32

**Component**

Only for the **GARDENIA**, **NARCISSUS**, **LAVENDER**, **CAMELLIA**, and **MANJUSHAKA** components.

**Behavior**

The parameter is used as a cutoff to limit the maximum expansion order for the Legendre orthogonal polynomials.

**Comment**

Only when *isort* = 2 or *isort* = 5 this parameter is useful. See [isort](p_isort.md) parameter for more details. How to choose a suitable *lemax* parameters is a tricky job. If *lemax* is too small, the calculated results won't be accurate. If *lemax* is too large, the so-called Gibbs oscillation will occur dramatically. According to our experiences, 32 or 48 may be a reasonable choice. It is worthy to emphasis that due to the limitation of implementation, *lemax* must be less than 50.
