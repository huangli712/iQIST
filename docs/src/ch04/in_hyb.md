### solver.hyb.in

**Introduction**

The *solver.hyb.in* file is an optional input file for iQIST software package. It is defined to initialize the Matsubara hybridization function ``\Delta(i\omega_n)``. This file is usually not generated by hand, but directly rename the output file of iQIST software package *solver.hyb.dat* as *solver.hyb.in*. The non-interacting hybridization function will be used as an input file on the condition that the user doesn't provide the initial *solver.hyb.in* file. However, the system will read in the parameters from the *solver.hyb.in* file given by the user to replace the default values.


**Format**

Similar to all the components in iQIST software package, the format of the *solver.hyb.in* file is as follows:

---

*column 1*: orbital index ``i``, integer

*column 2*: Matsubara frequency point, ``\omega_n``, double precision

*column 3*: Real part of hybridization function, spin up component, ``\Re \Delta_{i\uparrow}(i\omega_n)``, double precision

*column 4*: Imaginary part of hybridization function, spin up component, ``\Im \Delta_{i\uparrow}(i\omega_n)``, double precision

*column 5*: Real part of hybridization function, spin down component, ``\Re \Delta_{i\downarrow}(i\omega_n)``, double precision

*column 6*: Imaginary part of hybridization function, spin down component, ``\Im \Delta_{i\downarrow}(i\omega_n)``, double precision

!!! note

    In the *solver.hyb.in* file, we adopt the following orbital sequence:
    $$1\uparrow$$, $$2\uparrow$$, $$3\uparrow$$, $$\cdots$$, $$1\downarrow$$, $$2\downarrow$$, $$3\downarrow$$, $$\cdots$$
    In other words, the spin up part is always before the spin down part.
    The first block stores the data of the first energy band, the second block stores the data of the second energy band and so on. Here we don't consider the nondiagonal term.

**Code**

The corresponding Fortran code block for the writing of *solver.hybri.dat* file is as follows:

```fortran
! open data file: solver.hyb.in
     open(mytmp, file='solver.hyb.in', form='formatted', status='unknown')

! write it
     do i=1,norbs
         do j=1,mfreq
             write(mytmp,'(i6,5f16.8)') i, rmesh(j), &
                  real(ghub(j,i)), aimag(ghub(j,i)), &
                  real(shub(j,i)), aimag(shub(j,i))
         enddo ! over j={1,mfreq} loop
         write(mytmp,*) ! write empty lines
         write(mytmp,*)
     enddo ! over i={1,norbs} loop

! close data file
     close(mytmp)
```



Generally, you have to edit the *solver.hyb.in* file by yourself.
