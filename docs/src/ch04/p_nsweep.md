### Parameter: nsweep

**Definition**

Maximum number of quantum Monte Carlo sampling steps.

**Type**

Integer

**Default value**

20000000 (for CT-HYB impurity solvers) or 240000 (for HF-QMC impurity solver)

**Component**

ALL

**Behavior**

This is the number of Monte Carlo sampling steps conducted by the current process. If you run the quantum impurity solvers parallelly with ``N_{\text{procs}}`` processes, then the total number of Monte Carlo sampling steps in the calculation is 

```math
N_{\text{procs}} \times \text{nsweep}
```

Larger the *nsweep* is, more accurate and more time-consuming the calculation is. If you conduct the quantum impurity solver on many cores, you can decrease *nsweep*. But the minimal value of it should not be less than its default value. 

**Comment**

In order to improve the numerical quality and suppress the numerical noise, the most direct and practicable route is to increase *nsweep*.

If the data binning mode is activated, *nsweep* should not be larger than 200000000.

*nsweep* should be always larger than *ntherm*, *nwrite*, *nmonte*, and *ncarlo*.
