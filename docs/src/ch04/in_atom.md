### atom.cix

**Introduction**

We use the *atom.cix* file to store the eigensystem of the local interaction Hamiltonian. It is necessary for the general matrix version of the CT-QMC impurity solvers.

!!! warning

    The iQIST won't provide a default *atom.cix* file. Without this file, the general matrix version of the CT-QMC impurity solvers won't be started correctly.

**Format**

The *atom.cix* file is always generated by the **JASMINE** component. You should not modify it by yourself. Please see [Atomic eigenvalue problem solver](../ch06/README.md) for more details about the **JASMINE** component.

Now the **JASMINE** component can generate three kinds of *atom.cix* files.

* *TYPE 0*, only valid for the **CAMELLIA** component.
* *TYPE 1*, only valid for the **BEGONIA** and **LAVENDER** components.
* *TYPE 2*, only valid for the **MANJUSHAKA** and **PANSY** components.

!!! warning

    The format of the *atom.cix* file may be modified in the near future. So we don't describe its format here.
