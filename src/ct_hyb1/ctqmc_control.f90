!!
!! if isbnd == 1:
!!     the bands are not symmetrized
!!

!! @var iswor
!!
!! control flag, define which algorithm will be used to do the measurement
!!
!! if iswor == 1:
!!     without worm algorithm, fast but unreliable
!!
!! if iswor == 2:
!!     with worm algorithm, slow but more reliable. note that only some
!!     selected physical observables can be measured by this algorithm
!!
     integer, public, save :: iswor  = 1

!!
!! @var isort
!!
!! control flag, define which basis will be used to do the measurement
!!
!! if isort == 1:
!!     using standard representation
!!
!! if isort == 2:
!!     using legendre orthogonal polynomial representation
!!
!! if isort == 3:
!!     using intermediate (singular value decomposition) representation
!!
     integer, public, save :: isort  = 1

!!
!! @var isobs
!!
!! control flag, it is used to tell the code which physical observables
!! should be measured. we just use the following rules to judge:
!!
!! rule 1:
!!     isobs is firstly converted to a binary representation. for example,
!!     10_10 is converted to 1010_2, 15_10 is converted to 1111_2, etc
!!
!! rule 2:
!!     then we examine the bits one by one. if it is 1, then we try to do
!!     the calculation. if it is 0, then we ignore the calculation. for
!!     example, we just use the second bit (from right side to left side)
!!     to represent the calculation of kinetic energy fluctuation. so, if
!!     isobs is 10_10 (1010_2), we will try to compute the kinetic energy
!!     fluctuation. if isobs is 13_10 (1101_2), we will not calculate it
!!     since the second bit is 0
!!
!! the following are the definitions of bit representation:
!!
!! if p == 1:
!!     do nothing
!!
!! if p == 2:
!!     calculate kinetic energy fluctuation < k^2 > - < k >^2
!!
!! if p == 3:
!!     calculate fidelity susceptibility < k_l k_r > - < k_l > < k_r >
!!
!! if p == 4:
!!     calculate powers of local magnetization < S^n_z >
!!
!! example:
!!   ( 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1)_2
!! p = 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
!!
     integer, public, save :: isobs  = 1

!!
!! @var issus
!!
!! control flag, it is used to tell the code whether we should calculate
!! the charge or spin susceptibility. we just use the following rules to
!! make a judgement:
!!
!! rule 1:
!!     issus is firstly converted to a binary representation. for example,
!!     10_10 is converted to 1010_2, 15_10 is converted to 1111_2, etc
!!
!! rule 2:
!!     then we examine the bits one by one. if it is 1, then we try to do
!!     the calculation. if it is 0, then we ignore the calculation. for
!!     example, we just use the second bit (from right side to left side)
!!     to represent the calculation of spin-spin correlation function. so,
!!     if issus is 10_10 (1010_2), we will try to calculate the spin-spin
!!     correlation function. if issus is 13_10 (1101_2), since the second
!!     bit is 0 we will not calculate it
!!
!! the following are the definitions of bit representation:
!!
!! if p == 1:
!!     do nothing
!!
!! if p == 2:
!!     calculate spin-spin correlation function (time space)
!!
!! if p == 3:
!!     calculate charge-charge correlation function (time space)
!!
!! if p == 4:
!!     calculate spin-spin correlation function (frequency space)
!!
!! if p == 5:
!!     calculate charge-charge correlation function (frequency space)
!!
!! example:
!!   ( 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1)_2
!! p = 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
!!
     integer, public, save :: issus  = 1

!!
!! @var isvrt
!!
!! control flag, it is used to tell the code whether we should measure
!! the two-particle green's functions. we just use the following rules
!! to judge:
!!
!! rule 1:
!!     isvrt is firstly converted to a binary representation. for example,
!!     10_10 is converted to 1010_2, 15_10 is converted to 1111_2, etc
!!
!! rule 2:
!!     then we examine the bits one by one. if it is 1, then we try to do
!!     the calculation. if it is 0, then we ignore the calculation. for
!!     example, we just use the second bit (from right side to left side)
!!     to represent the calculation of two-particle green's function for
!!     the particle-hole channel in AABB block structure. so, if isvrt is
!!     10_10 (1010_2), we will try to compute the specified two-particle
!!     green's function. if isvrt is 13_10 (1101_2), we will not calculate
!!     it since the second bit is 0
!!
!! the following are the definitions of bit representation:
!!
!! if p == 1:
!!     do nothing
!!
!! if p == 2:
!!     calculate two-particle green's function
!!     block: AABB
!!     channel: particle-hole
!!
!! if p == 3:
!!     calculate two-particle green's function
!!     block: ABBA
!!     channel: particle-hole
!!
!! if p == 4:
!!     calculate two-particle green's function
!!     block: AABB
!!     channel: particle-particle
!!
!! if p == 5:
!!     calculate two-particle green's function
!!     block: ABBA

!!
!! @var nflip
!!
!! flip period for spin up and spin down states. some care must be taken

!! orbital. note that nflip could be negative. if nflip /= 0, then the
!! absolute value of nflip is the flip period
!!
!! in this code, nowadays the following flip schemes are supported:
!!
!! if nflip == 0:
