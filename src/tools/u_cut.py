## Introduction
## ============
##
## It is a python script. The purpose of this script is to split the data
## file into several pieces. We usually use it to deal with the following
## files:
##     solver.green.dat
##     solver.sgm.dat
##     solver.sp_w.dat
##     solver.sp_t.dat
##     solver.ch_w.dat
##     solver.ch_t.dat
## so that they can be postprocessed by the other analytical continuation
## codes, such as SpM or OmegaMaxEnt.
##
## Usage
## =====
##
## ./u_cut.py [-h] [-b NBLOCK] [-l NLINE] fn
##
## Here fn is the original data file. NBLOCK means number of blocks, and
## NLINE means number of lines for each block. The output files should be
## fn.*, * means the index of data block. In other words, each data block
## in the original data file should be converted into a single file. The
## following shows a few concrete examples:
##
## Solit the imaginary-time green's function
##     ./u_cut -b 2 -l 1024 solver.green.dat
##
## Split the matsubara self-energy function
##     ./u_cut -b 2 -l 8193 solver.sgm.dat
